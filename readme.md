```

* * *

Installation
------------

1.  Clone or download this repository

Races.json Example
------------------

```json
{
    "human": {

    },
    "elf": {
        "dexterity": 2
    },
    "dwarf": {
        "constitution": 2
    },
    "gnome": {
        "intelligence": 2
    },
    "dragonborn": {
        "strength": 2,
        "charisma": 1
    },
    "deepling": {

    },
    "zw√∂lf": {

    }
}
```

*   Use `zw√∂lf` for a special 12-point evenly distributed character.
    
*   All other races apply bonuses on top of rolled stats.
    

* * *

Usage
-----

### Roll dice


```bash
python complex_af.py roll 3d6 python complex_af.py roll d20
```

*   Rolls dice using standard notation.
    
*   Outputs individual rolls and total.
    

* * *

### Create a character

#### Random character


```bash
python complex_af.py create --random
```

#### Manual character


```bash
python complex_af.py create --name "Asha" --class wizard --race elf
``` 

*   Stats are generated using **4d6 drop the lowest** per ability.
    
*   Racial bonuses are applied automatically.
    

* * *

### List characters


```bash
python complex_af.py list
```

*   Shows all saved characters with color-coded stats.
    
*   Lists indices for easy deletion.
    

* * *

### Delete a character


```bash
python complex_af.py delete 1
```

*   Deletes character at index `1` (0-based).
    
*   Use `list` first to see indices.
    

* * *

Character Storage
-----------------

*   Characters are saved in **`player_character.json`** (a list).
    
*   Example entry:
    


```json
{
    "name": "PC_1",
    "class": "wizard",
    "race": "elf",
    "raw_stats": {
        "strength": 12,
        "dexterity": 15,
        "constitution": 13,
        "intelligence": 14,
        "wisdom": 10,
        "charisma": 8
    },
    "final_stats": {
        "strength": 12,
        "dexterity": 17,
        "constitution": 13,
        "intelligence": 14,
        "wisdom": 10,
        "charisma": 8
    }
}
```

* * *

Notes
-----

*   The CLI uses **standard 5e rolling rules**: `4d6 drop the lowest` per ability.
    
*   Special race `"zw√∂lf"` is unique: base stats = 2 per ability (total 12) before bonuses.
    
*   Customize `Races.json` to add new races or modify racial bonuses.
    
*   All commands are color-coded for readability.
    

* * *

Next Planned Features
---------------------

*   Point-buy or standard array stat methods
    
*   One JSON file per character for easier management
    
*   Printable character sheets
    
*   Extended race/class/customization options
    

* * *

Example Workflow
----------------


```bash
# Roll dice
python complex_af.py roll 4d6
# Create a random character
python complex_af.py create --random
# List all characters
python complex_af.py list
# Delete a character by index
python complex_af.py delete 0
```
